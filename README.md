# Stage Three - Ideate & Prototyping
- After conducting a task-centered system walkthrough of our major tasks (Create, View, Filter), we realized that our task description for creating a new problem had to be modified. We decided to omit the ability for users to upload a new photo for wall configurations since the climbing gym will take care of this and it will improve the overall user experience. 
# Stage Four - Prototyping & Evaluation
# Stage Five - Produce
